2) It is important to choose a License because the license dictates how the project is to redistributed. This allows developers to add their work while being properly attributed and losing their work. It also guarantees the right to use the software

3) You should not use a license without an explicit license due the risks of the project. A project without a license can be removed and potentially copyrighted. Developers can lose all their work with the death of a project.

5) Android is released under the GPL v2.0 license. The operating system is based on Linux, which itself is under the GPL v2.0 license. The license requires that other projects based on it must also redistribute it under the same license. Android had to be under this license due to its use of Linux. https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)

7) When considering developers all of these licenses are good choice. However, the added benfit of the GPL and LGPL to include install instructions can help developers become familar with the work quicker. Also, the requirement of marking changes helps developers put their name of the project and fell like they are contributing. Companies will appreciate the LGPL allowance to use libraries in their own software without having to distribute the software under the same license. Also BSD/Apache does not allow the use of trademark so comapnies will appreciate that extra brand security. For the common the good, the BSD is the best option. It allows almost unlimited freedom for the software and can be used almost anywhere. This flexability allows for the porject to grow and develope rapidly.
